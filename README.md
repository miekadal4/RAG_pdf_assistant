## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines retrieval of documents with generation capabilities of language models. It helps in providing accurate and context-aware responses based on the content of the documents.

### How does the chatbot understand my questions?

The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse your questions and retrieve relevant information from the PDF document. It then generates a response based on the extracted data.

### Can I use this with any PDF document?

Yes, the RAG PDF Assistant can work with most PDF documents. However, the quality of responses may vary depending on the complexity and formatting of the document.

### Is my data safe when using this application?

Since the RAG PDF Assistant runs locally, your data remains on your machine. It does not send any information to external servers.

### How can I report issues or bugs?

You can report issues by opening an issue in the GitHub repository. Please provide a detailed description of the problem and steps to reproduce it.

## Future Improvements

We aim to continuously improve the RAG PDF Assistant. Some planned features include:

- **Multi-language Support**: Allowing users to interact in different languages.
- **Enhanced Search Capabilities**: Implementing more advanced search algorithms for better results.
- **Integration with Other Document Formats**: Supporting formats like DOCX, TXT, etc.
- **User Feedback System**: Enabling users to provide feedback on the chatbot's responses.

## Conclusion

The RAG PDF Assistant is a powerful tool for anyone looking to interact with PDF documents using natural language. With its robust features and user-friendly interface, it simplifies the process of extracting information from documents.
